## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

For this recipe page, I used semantic HTML to keep the structure clear and accessible. The layout is simple: the header introduces the recipe with a title, image, and brief description, followed by sections for prep time, ingredients, instructions, and nutritional info. I used unordered lists for ingredients and prep times, while ordered lists show the step-by-step instructions. Important details like cooking times and steps are highlighted with <strong> tags, and the nutrition info is displayed in an easy-to-read table. The image includes descriptive alt text for accessibility, and there's a footer crediting the source. Overall, the goal was to create a clean, organized, and user-friendly design that's also easy to navigate.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned the importance of using semantic HTML to structure content in a meaningful way, which improves both accessibility and SEO. I also became more comfortable with organizing content using proper tags like <header>, <section>, and <footer> to ensure the layout is logical and easy to follow. By using lists for steps and ingredients, I saw how HTML elements can naturally guide the user through a process. I also learned to use CSS to create a visually appealing layout, balancing typography, spacing, and color to make the page not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, incorporating responsive design helped me better understand how to create a layout that works well across different screen sizes.
